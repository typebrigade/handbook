# Organising commitments

_TODO, the following are some ideas_

- The core, recurring meetup events will be free to attend
- The event will be run with the goal of breaking event, and if there is ever a surplus somehow, it will be invested back into the meetup (ex. going towards a speaker or speakers, reducing costs of a one-off workshop, etc.)
