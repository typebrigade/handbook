# Handbook

[Type Brigade](http://typebrigade.com)’s Handbook is a summary of what we’ve learned and helpful resources while organising the event.

Our GitBook-style [table of contents](SUMMARY.md) also acts as a loose TODO list.

This is very much a work-in-progress. Feel free to tweet [@typebrigade](http://twitter.com/typebrigade) or email [kenneth@typebrigade.com](mailto:kenneth@typebrigade.com) with question, or even just open an issue.
