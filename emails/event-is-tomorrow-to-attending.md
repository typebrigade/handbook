# _Tomorrow_ is Type Brigade

Hi everyone,
Just a quick reminder that Type Brigade №_#_ is _tomorrow_! Can’t wait to see you there.

- Doors are at 6:30PM
- Talks begin right at 7:00PM
- No admittance during talks

The event is at Mobify HQ, on the 3rd Floor of 948 Homer Street, Vancouver. If you have trouble finding it, tweet @typebrigade, or call/text me at 780 952 2077.

If it looks like you aren’t able to make it, could you help us out and change your RSVP to “NO” so we can open up your spot to someone on the waiting list? Thanks very much!

See you at Type Brigade, Kenneth
